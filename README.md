This project was part of a course on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/43acdbe6-abec-4648-ae79-3842066a03ad) and focused on the following learning goals:

- Understanding the difference between small and large files
- Upgrading and extending an existing app — much of the code, such as the entire frontend, was provided
- Using AWS S3 and Go to efficiently store and serve files (assets)
- Getting familiar with object storage and CDNs using AWS S3 and CloudFront as examples — transferable to other providers
- Learning higher-level concepts like caching and video streaming
- A secondary goal was to practice refactoring and improve the ability to work with existing codebases in a structured manner.

Course structure (roughly broken down into three stages):

1. File management basics: Working with files in a traditional application without cloud integration.
2. Scalable asset handling with serverless technologies: Using AWS S3 to store and serve files at scale.
3. Efficient streaming & caching: Introduction to video streaming and improving performance through smart caching.
